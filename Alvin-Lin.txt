    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 

        The box model is a method for specifying the amount of space an element takes up. Padding, borders, and margins all contribute to the final size of an element. If an element with a width of 100px has a padding of 50px, a border of 20px, and a margin of 50px,  its actual width will be 330px.

        Border-box-sizing takes padding, borders, and margins into account so that the width of the element is its actual width.
